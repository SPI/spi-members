Subject: Your SPI Contributing Membership Application

Dear XXX,

You have recently signed up for a SPI Contributing Membership application.
At the moment, the membership process is primarily open only for Debian
Developers since the membership pages are still in the testing phase.
You appear not to be a Debian Developer.  This does not mean that you
cannot become a Contributing Member -- it simply means that we have to
check why you want to become a Contributing Member and if you are eligible.

The membership guidelines at http://www.spi-inc.org/membershipguidelines
say that

|   Contributing membership should be available to the following people:
|     * active members of SPI affiliated projects
|     * active members of any large free software development project
|     * any person who has made a significant contribution to the free
|       software community
|     * any person who actively contributes to the free software community

Can you please tell me about your contributions and possibly supply some
URLs I can check out for more information.

I hope to hear from you soon.

Best regards,
