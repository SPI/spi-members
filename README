This is the SPI membership web application, which lives at:

https://members.spi-inc.org/

It enables the following actions:

 * New member registration

  Non-contributing members just need to apply for a new account and
  verify their email address.

 * Contributing member application

  Once a user is a valid non-contributing member they can submit an
  application for contributing membership, providing details of why they
  meet the criteria.

 * Management of member applications

  Users who are marked as application managers can review outstanding
  applications for contributing membership and approve or deny them
  as appropriate.

Further functionality is pending and will be added here once complete.
See the TODO file for more details.

The app is written in Python using the Flask frame work and designed to
run on a Debian 8 (jessie) host. It requires at least the following
Debian packages to be installed:

python python-flask python-flask-login python-flaskext.wtf

For the purposes of testing the app can be invoked as:

$ SPIAPP_CONFIG=local-test.cfg python spiwebapp.py
