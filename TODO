Outstanding things to do:

 * Improve email verification / password reset handling
   - We should not just send out a new password for a reset, but instead
     a token.
 * Implement ability for managers to edit users
 * Add last active link beside last active date?
 * Password reset link is not obvious enough on login page [tbm]
