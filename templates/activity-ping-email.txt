Dear {{ name }},

This email is sent as part of the process of ensuring that SPI
contributing members wish to maintain their membership status. Voting
status for previous SPI elections is used as an initial data point to
indicate that a member should potentially be considered inactive.

We have not seen a vote from you in the most recent election. If you
consider yourself an active contributing SPI member and wish to retain
this status please let us know by updating your activity using the
following link within the next 4 weeks:

https://members.spi-inc.org/updateactive

If you are not currently active as an SPI contributing member you need
take no action; your status will be downgraded to that of a
non-contributing member. You are, of course, free to restore your
contributing membership status at some future point should you wish to.

The SPI Membership Committee <membership@spi-inc.org>
